// Problem #1 - Flattening

// Use the reduce method in combination with the concat method to “flatten” an array of arrays
// into a single array that has all the elements of the original arrays.


// Solution #1





// Problem #2 - Your own for loop

// Write a higher-order function loop that provides something like a for loop statement.
// It takes a value, a test function, an update function, and a body function. 
// Each iteration, it first runs the test function on the current loop value and stops if that returns false.
// Then it calls the body function, giving it the current value. 
// Finally, it calls the update function to create a new value and starts from the beginning.

// When defining the function, you can use a regular loop to do the actual looping.


// Solution #2





// Problem #3 - Everything

// Analogous to the some method, arrays also have an every method. 
// This one returns true when the given function returns true for every element in the array.
// In a way, some is a version of the || operator that acts on arrays, and every is like the && operator.

// Implement every as a function that takes an array and a predicate function as parameters.
// Write two versions, one using a loop and one using the some method.


// Solution #3
